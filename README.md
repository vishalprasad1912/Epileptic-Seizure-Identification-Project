# Epileptic-Seizure-Identification-Project
A Machine-Learning Framework for Epileptic Seizure Identification using Bangalore EEG Data

### üß† About EEG

An EEG (electroencephalogram) is a test that tracks your brain‚Äôs electrical signals. It checks for epilepsy or other brain conditions. It‚Äôs painless, safe and can be done while you‚Äôre awake or asleep. Your provider will use the results to help guide a diagnosis and treatment.

In this project, we utilize the **Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset (BEED)** ‚Äî a comprehensive and high-fidelity EEG dataset recorded at a 256 Hz sampling rate using the standard 10‚Äì20 electrode system. The dataset consists of 16,000 EEG segments of 20 seconds each, categorized into four classes:  
- **0 ‚Äì Recording of healthy subjects (control group without epileptic seizures)**
- **1 ‚Äì Recording of generalized seizures** 
- **2 ‚Äì Recording of focal seizures**
- **3 ‚Äì Recording of seizure events (including activities such as eye blinking or constant staring)**

This dataset supports research and development in seizure detection, classification, and EEG-based machine learning applications.
